# ACI

ACI (Application Centric Infrastructure) is a software-defined networking solution developed by Cisco. It is designed to provide centralized management and automation of network infrastructure for modern data centers.

ACI helps organizations to achieve rapid application deployment, simplified operations, and improved security by providing a holistic view of the entire network fabric. It supports both physical and virtual environments and provides seamless integration with existing network infrastructure.

ACI architecture is based on a policy-driven model, which enables IT administrators to define and enforce network policies in a consistent manner. It uses a software controller to manage the entire network fabric, which includes switches, routers, and other network devices.

ACI also provides an open API framework that allows integration with third-party tools and services, enabling automation and orchestration of network services. This makes it an ideal solution for organizations that require a highly scalable and flexible network infrastructure to support their digital transformation initiatives.

# ACI can be beneficial for organizations that want to achieve the following:

Simplify network operations: ACI provides a centralized management interface that enables IT teams to configure and monitor network infrastructure from a single pane of glass. This can help reduce the complexity of managing network infrastructure and improve operational efficiency.

Improve security: ACI provides micro-segmentation capabilities that enable organizations to create network segments and policies to restrict access to sensitive data and applications. This can help improve overall network security and compliance.

Increase agility: ACI's policy-based automation capabilities enable organizations to rapidly provision network services and make changes to network infrastructure in real-time. This can help organizations respond more quickly to changing business requirements.

Reduce costs: ACI provides a more efficient way to manage network infrastructure, which can help reduce the overall cost of network operations. Additionally, ACI's automation capabilities can help reduce the amount of manual labor required to manage network infrastructure.

To use ACI, organizations need to deploy Cisco ACI hardware and software components, including ACI switches, the ACI fabric controller, and the ACI application policy infrastructure controller (APIC). After deployment, IT teams can use the APIC to configure and manage network policies, and provision network services in a policy-based manner.

Organizations can also use ACI to integrate with other tools and services, such as service meshes, firewalls, and load balancers, to provide a more comprehensive network infrastructure solution. This can help improve overall network automation and orchestration capabilities.

# Factors to consider when using ACI include:

Network complexity: ACI is best suited for organizations with large and complex network infrastructure requirements. If an organization has a relatively simple network infrastructure, ACI may not be the most cost-effective solution.

Integration with existing infrastructure: Before deploying ACI, organizations should consider how it will integrate with their existing network infrastructure. This can include evaluating compatibility with current hardware and software, as well as assessing how ACI will work with existing management tools and processes.

Skills and expertise: ACI requires specialized skills and expertise to configure and manage effectively. Organizations should assess the availability of these skills in their organization or consider partnering with a Cisco ACI implementation partner.

# Tools used with ACI include:

Cisco APIC: The Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) is the central management and automation component of the ACI solution. It provides a policy-based approach to network management, enabling administrators to define and manage network policies in a consistent manner.

Cisco ACI Fabric: The ACI Fabric is a set of hardware switches that form the network infrastructure layer of the ACI solution. The fabric provides a high-performance, scalable, and resilient network infrastructure that can be managed centrally using the APIC.

Network service appliances: ACI can be integrated with a variety of third-party network service appliances, including firewalls, load balancers, and WAN optimization appliances. These appliances can be managed using the APIC, providing a consistent policy-based approach to network management.

APIs and automation tools: ACI provides an open API framework that enables integration with a wide range of automation tools and services, including Ansible, Kubernetes, and Terraform. This can help organizations to automate network provisioning and management tasks, improving operational efficiency and agility.

# ACI is a network infrastructure solution developed by Cisco. It can be categorized as a platform that provides a set of hardware and software components designed to work together to enable policy-based automation and management of network infrastructure.

The ACI platform includes the following components:

ACI Fabric: The hardware switches that form the network infrastructure layer of the ACI solution.

APIC (Application Policy Infrastructure Controller): The central management and automation component of the ACI solution.

ACI Virtualization: The software component of ACI that enables virtualization of network services and functions.

ACI Toolkit: A set of open-source tools and libraries that enable programmability and automation of ACI.

In terms of models, ACI is based on a policy-based automation and management model. This means that administrators define network policies that specify how network traffic should be handled, and the ACI platform enforces those policies consistently across the network infrastructure. This policy-based model enables rapid deployment of network services and simplifies network management by reducing the need for manual configuration of network devices.

ACI also supports a declarative model of network configuration. In this model, administrators define the desired state of the network infrastructure, and the ACI platform takes care of the underlying configuration details. This can help reduce errors and simplify network management by providing a more abstract and high-level view of network infrastructure configuration.
