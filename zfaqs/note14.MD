# Detailed understanding of core network technologies (Routing, Switching, wireless, MPLS, tunneling, QoS etc.)

A detailed understanding of core network technologies refers to the comprehensive knowledge of networking concepts and technologies that form the foundation of modern network infrastructure. The following are some of the core network technologies that a network architect should have a detailed understanding of:

Routing: Routing refers to the process of selecting the best path for data to travel across a network. A network architect should have a thorough understanding of routing protocols such as OSPF, BGP, and EIGRP, and be able to design and configure complex routing schemes.

Switching: Switching refers to the process of forwarding data between devices on a local area network (LAN). A network architect should have a detailed understanding of switching technologies such as VLANs, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), and EtherChannel.

Wireless: Wireless refers to the transmission of data using radio waves rather than physical cables. A network architect should have a detailed understanding of wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee, and be able to design and configure wireless networks.

MPLS: Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a technology used to route data across wide area networks (WANs). A network architect should have a detailed understanding of MPLS and be able to design and configure MPLS-based networks.

Tunneling: Tunneling refers to the process of encapsulating data in one protocol and transmitting it over a network using another protocol. A network architect should have a detailed understanding of tunneling technologies such as Virtual Private Network (VPN), Secure Shell (SSH), and Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE).

Quality of Service (QoS): QoS refers to the ability to prioritize certain types of network traffic over others. A network architect should have a detailed understanding of QoS technologies such as Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and Traffic Shaping, and be able to design and configure QoS policies.

Overall, a detailed understanding of core network technologies is essential for a network architect to design, configure, and troubleshoot complex network infrastructures.
