# cisco ACI technology and Nexus switches

Cisco ACI (Application Centric Infrastructure) is a software-defined networking (SDN) architecture that provides centralized automation and management of a data center network. It uses a policy-based approach to networking, where applications and their requirements drive network configuration and policies, rather than manual configuration of individual networking devices.

ACI is built on top of Cisco Nexus switches, which are purpose-built data center switches that provide high performance, low latency, and high density for both virtualized and non-virtualized environments. Nexus switches support a range of protocols, including Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and FCoE (Fibre Channel over Ethernet). They also offer advanced features such as Virtual Port Channels (vPCs), Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN), and FabricPath.

ACI uses a software-defined networking controller called the Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC), which provides a centralized point of management for the entire ACI fabric. The APIC communicates with the Nexus switches to push down policies and configurations, and to collect telemetry data for analytics and troubleshooting.

Overall, Cisco ACI with Nexus switches provides a scalable, secure, and automated solution for modern data center networking. It allows organizations to rapidly deploy and manage applications, while reducing the complexity and cost of network infrastructure.

# Cisco ACI technology with Nexus switches is important for several reasons:

Centralized management: ACI provides a centralized management point for the entire data center network, allowing administrators to automate and streamline network configuration, policy enforcement, and troubleshooting. This reduces the risk of human error and enables faster deployment of new applications and services.

Application-driven networking: ACI allows administrators to define network policies based on the specific requirements of applications, rather than manually configuring individual networking devices. This results in a more agile, flexible, and responsive network that can adapt to changing application needs.

Security: ACI provides a comprehensive security framework that includes microsegmentation, which can isolate and protect critical workloads and applications from unauthorized access. It also includes network-wide encryption and policy-based controls that ensure consistent security across the entire network.

Scalability: ACI is designed to scale horizontally and vertically, allowing organizations to easily add new resources and accommodate growth. This is achieved through a spine-leaf architecture, which enables high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity between all devices in the network.

Overall, Cisco ACI with Nexus switches provides a modern, software-defined approach to data center networking that improves agility, security, and scalability while reducing complexity and cost.

# Cisco ACI technology with Nexus switches works by creating a policy-based overlay network on top of the physical network infrastructure. The network is divided into two main components: the physical infrastructure, which consists of Nexus switches, and the logical infrastructure, which is managed by the Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC).

Here are the main steps involved in how ACI works:

Application profiling: The administrator uses the APIC to define an application profile, which includes the requirements and dependencies of the application. The APIC then translates the application profile into network policies.

Policy definition: The policies are defined in the APIC and applied to the logical infrastructure, including endpoint groups (EPGs) that define the application components and service graphs that define the required network services for each EPG.

Fabric discovery: The APIC discovers the physical fabric by communicating with the Nexus switches and building a topology map of the network.

Fabric configuration: The APIC pushes the network policies to the Nexus switches, which configure the fabric accordingly. This includes creating the necessary VLANs, VXLAN tunnels, and routing configurations.

Policy enforcement: The Nexus switches enforce the policies and provide telemetry data back to the APIC for analytics and troubleshooting.

Overall, ACI uses a centralized controller to automate and manage network policies, which are applied to the logical infrastructure to create a policy-based overlay network on top of the physical infrastructure. The Nexus switches provide the physical connectivity and forwarding capabilities, while the APIC provides the orchestration and automation layer.

# Several factors are important when implementing Cisco ACI technology with Nexus switches:

Application requirements: The main goal of ACI is to enable the network to be driven by the needs of the applications it supports. Therefore, it is essential to fully understand the application requirements in terms of performance, security, and availability, as these will guide the network policies and configuration.

Network design: ACI uses a spine-leaf topology, which requires careful consideration of the physical network design. The number of spine and leaf switches, as well as the number of links between them, should be carefully planned to ensure optimal performance and scalability.

Nexus switch selection: ACI is designed to work with Cisco Nexus switches, so it is important to select the appropriate Nexus switches for the specific deployment. Factors to consider include the number of ports required, the throughput and latency requirements, and the level of advanced features needed, such as vPCs, VXLAN, and FabricPath.

Staff expertise: Implementing ACI technology requires specialized knowledge and expertise in both software-defined networking and Cisco Nexus switches. It is important to have a skilled team in place to design, deploy, and manage the ACI fabric.

Integration with existing infrastructure: ACI should be integrated with the existing data center infrastructure, including virtualization platforms, storage systems, and network services. This requires coordination and planning across multiple teams, so it is important to ensure that all stakeholders are involved in the planning process.

Overall, successful implementation of Cisco ACI technology with Nexus switches requires careful planning and consideration of the application requirements, network design, switch selection, staff expertise, and integration with existing infrastructure.

# There are several tools and technologies available for deploying and managing Cisco ACI technology with Nexus switches:

Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC): The APIC is the central management tool for ACI, providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring and managing the network policies and services.

Cisco Nexus switches: The Nexus switches are the foundation of the ACI fabric, providing the physical connectivity and forwarding capabilities for the network. They come in a range of models, including the Nexus 9000 series and the Nexus 3000 series.

Cisco Network Assurance Engine: This tool provides real-time visibility and validation of the network fabric, ensuring that it is operating according to the intended policies and configurations.

Cisco CloudCenter: This tool provides application-centric management of hybrid cloud environments, enabling IT teams to deploy and manage applications across on-premises and public cloud infrastructures.

Cisco UCS Director: This tool provides a unified management platform for computing, networking, and storage resources, allowing administrators to automate provisioning and orchestration tasks.

Cisco Tetration: This tool provides comprehensive visibility and analytics of application behavior across the entire infrastructure, helping organizations to improve security and compliance.

Overall, these tools and technologies provide a comprehensive suite of management and monitoring capabilities for Cisco ACI technology with Nexus switches, enabling organizations to deploy, configure, and manage their data center networks with agility, security, and scalability.
