# Experience in network automation and troubleshooting methodologies

There are several tools available for network automation and troubleshooting methodologies that a network architect can use to gain experience. Here are some of the commonly used tools:

Ansible: Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It can be used to automate repetitive tasks, such as software updates, configuration changes, and network device configurations.

Puppet: Puppet is another open-source automation tool used for configuration management and application deployment. It can be used to manage network devices, monitor network performance, and automate network workflows.

Python: Python is a popular programming language used for network automation and scripting. It can be used to write scripts that automate network tasks, such as configuration management, network monitoring, and network troubleshooting.

Wireshark: Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer used for troubleshooting network issues. It can capture and analyze network traffic, allowing a network architect to diagnose and resolve network problems.

tcpdump: Tcpdump is another network protocol analyzer used for capturing and analyzing network traffic. It can be used to diagnose network issues, monitor network performance, and troubleshoot network problems.

Traceroute: Traceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to trace the path of network packets through the network. It can be used to diagnose network connectivity issues and locate network devices that are causing problems.

By using these tools, a network architect can gain experience in network automation and troubleshooting methodologies and develop the skills needed to design, implement, and troubleshoot network systems.
