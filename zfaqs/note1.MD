# Define and review global network architecture standards that address requirements

Defining and reviewing global network architecture standards that address requirements involves developing a set of guidelines, policies, and procedures that ensure consistency and best practices across an organization's network infrastructure. These standards should be designed to address the specific requirements of the organization, such as security, performance, scalability, and reliability.

To define and review global network architecture standards that address requirements, the following steps can be taken:

Define the network architecture requirements: This involves identifying the organization's network requirements and determining the network architecture that will best meet these requirements.

Identify industry standards: It's important to consider industry best practices and standards when defining network architecture standards. These standards can provide a baseline for comparison and ensure that the organization's network architecture is aligned with industry trends.

Develop network architecture standards: Based on the organization's requirements and industry standards, develop a set of network architecture standards that outline the design and implementation of the network infrastructure. These standards should address key areas such as network topology, security, performance, and scalability.

Review and update network architecture standards: As the organization's requirements change, it's important to review and update network architecture standards to ensure they continue to address the organization's needs. This should be an ongoing process to ensure that the organization's network architecture remains up-to-date and effective.

Communicate network architecture standards: Once network architecture standards have been defined and reviewed, it's important to communicate them to relevant stakeholders across the organization. This can help ensure that everyone understands the standards and works to adhere to them.

By defining and reviewing global network architecture standards that address requirements, organizations can ensure that their network infrastructure is designed and implemented in a way that meets their needs and aligns with industry best practices.
