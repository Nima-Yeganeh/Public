# Detailed understanding of core network technologies (Routing, Switching, wireless, MPLS, tunneling, QoS etc.)

Sure, here is some more information about the core network technologies:

Routing: Routing is the process of selecting the best path for data to travel across a network. There are different routing protocols such as OSPF, BGP, EIGRP, IS-IS, and RIP. A network architect needs to have a detailed understanding of these protocols and be able to design and configure routing schemes that are efficient, reliable, and scalable.

Switching: Switching is the process of forwarding data between devices on a local area network (LAN). There are different switching technologies such as VLANs, STP, EtherChannel, and Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). A network architect needs to have a detailed understanding of these technologies and be able to design and configure switching architectures that are secure, resilient, and optimized for performance.

Wireless: Wireless technologies are used for transmitting data using radio waves instead of physical cables. Wi-Fi is the most common wireless technology used in enterprise networks. A network architect needs to have a detailed understanding of wireless technologies, including the different Wi-Fi standards, wireless security protocols, and wireless site surveying techniques. They should also be able to design and configure wireless networks that are secure, reliable, and scalable.

MPLS: Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a technology used to route data across wide area networks (WANs). MPLS is used to provide quality of service (QoS), traffic engineering, and virtual private network (VPN) services. A network architect needs to have a detailed understanding of MPLS and be able to design and configure MPLS-based networks that are scalable, resilient, and optimized for performance.

Tunneling: Tunneling is the process of encapsulating data in one protocol and transmitting it over a network using another protocol. VPN is the most common tunneling technology used in enterprise networks. A network architect needs to have a detailed understanding of VPN technologies, including the different VPN types (e.g., site-to-site VPN, remote access VPN), VPN protocols (e.g., IPSec, SSL), and VPN authentication and encryption methods.

Quality of Service (QoS): QoS is the ability to prioritize certain types of network traffic over others. Differentiated Services (DiffServ) is the most common QoS technology used in enterprise networks. A network architect needs to have a detailed understanding of QoS technologies, including DiffServ, traffic shaping, and classification and marking techniques. They should also be able to design and configure QoS policies that are optimized for performance, reliability, and security.

Overall, a network architect needs to have a detailed understanding of the core network technologies to design, configure, and troubleshoot complex network infrastructures that meet the business requirements of the organization.
