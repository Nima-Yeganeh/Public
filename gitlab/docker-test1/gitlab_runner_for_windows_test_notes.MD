To configure a Windows Docker host as a GitLab Runner for GitLab, follow these steps:

Install Docker on the Windows host. You can download Docker for Windows from the Docker website.

Install GitLab Runner on the Windows host. You can download the GitLab Runner installer for Windows from the GitLab website.

gitlab-runner install
gitlab-runner start

Register the GitLab Runner with your GitLab instance by running the following command:

gitlab-runner register

This will start an interactive configuration process for registering the GitLab Runner with your GitLab instance. Follow the prompts to complete the registration process. Make sure to select "docker" as the executor during the registration process.

Configure the GitLab Runner to use the Docker executor by editing the config.toml file. The config.toml file is located in the GitLab Runner installation directory, usually in C:\GitLab-Runner. Open the file in a text editor and add the following lines:

[[runners]]
  executor = "docker"
  [runners.docker]
    tls_verify = false
    image = "docker:latest"
    privileged = true
    disable_entrypoint_overwrite = false
    oom_kill_disable = false
    disable_cache = false
    volumes = ["/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock", "/cache"]
    shm_size = 0

This configuration sets the Docker executor to use the docker:latest image and enables privileged mode, which allows the Docker containers to run with elevated privileges. It also maps the Docker socket and a cache directory to the Runner container.

Restart the GitLab Runner service to apply the configuration changes:

gitlab-runner restart

This will restart the GitLab Runner service and apply the updated config.toml file.

Once the configuration is complete, you should be able to run GitLab CI/CD pipelines on the Windows Docker host. To test the setup, create a new GitLab repository with a .gitlab-ci.yml file that specifies a job to run on the Windows Docker host, and push the repository to your GitLab instance. The GitLab Runner should pick up the job and execute it on the Windows Docker host.
