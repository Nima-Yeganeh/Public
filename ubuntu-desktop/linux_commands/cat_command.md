Here are some examples of how to use the cat command in Linux:

    Display the contents of a file:
cat file.txt

    Display the contents of multiple files at once:
cat file1.txt file2.txt

    Concatenate the contents of multiple files and write the output to a new file:
cat file1.txt file2.txt > new_file.txt

    Display the contents of a file with line numbers:
cat -n file.txt

    Display the contents of a file, but replace tabs with spaces:
cat -T file.txt

    Display the contents of a file, but display non-printable characters as escape sequences:
cat -v file.txt
