Here are some examples of how to use the mv command in Linux:

    Rename a file:
mv old_file.txt new_file.txt

    Move a file to a new location:
mv file.txt /path/to/new/location/

    Move a directory to a new location:
mv directory/ /path/to/new/location/

    Rename a directory:
mv old_directory/ new_directory/

    Move all files in a directory to a new location:
mv /path/to/directory/* /path/to/new/location/

    Move all files in a directory (including subdirectories) to a new location:
mv -r /path/to/directory/ /path/to/new/location/
