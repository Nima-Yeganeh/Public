Here are some examples of how to use the mkdir command in Linux:

    Create a new directory:
mkdir new_directory

    Create multiple directories at once:
mkdir directory1 directory2 directory3

    Create a directory with a specific path:
mkdir /path/to/new_directory

    Create a directory with specific permissions:
mkdir -m 755 new_directory

    Create a directory and all its parent directories:
mkdir -p /path/to/new_directory

    Create a directory with a specific owner and group:
mkdir -m 755 -o user -g group new_directory
