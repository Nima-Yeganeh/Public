Here are some examples of how to use the rm command in Linux:

    Remove a file:
rm filename

    Remove multiple files at once:
rm file1 file2 file3

    Remove a directory and all its contents (use with caution!):
rm -r directory

    Prompt for confirmation before deleting each file or directory:
rm -i filename

    Forcefully remove a file or directory without prompting for confirmation (use with caution!):
rm -f filename

    Remove all files and directories in the current directory that match a specific pattern:
rm pattern*
