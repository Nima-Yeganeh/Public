# dovecot

-   Dovecot is an open-source email server and mailbox software that provides POP3 and IMAP protocols for retrieving emails. It is designed to work with standard mail clients such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Apple Mail, among others. Dovecot also supports various authentication mechanisms, including passwords, plain text, SSL/TLS, and CRAM-MD5, to ensure secure communication between email clients and the mail server.

-   Dovecot is widely used in Linux-based email systems as it is lightweight, fast, and reliable. It is compatible with multiple operating systems, including Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, macOS, and Windows. Dovecot's architecture is modular and can be extended with plugins to add features such as quota support, antispam filtering, and mailbox indexing.

-   Dovecot uses port number 143 for the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and port number 993 for the Internet Message Access Protocol over SSL/TLS (IMAPS). It also supports the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) on port number 110 and the Post Office Protocol version 3 over SSL/TLS (POP3S) on port number 995. However, these port numbers can be changed in the Dovecot configuration if necessary.
