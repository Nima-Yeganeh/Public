salt - This is the primary SaltStack command used for executing commands on Salt Minions. It can be used to execute remote commands, manage packages, install software, and more.

salt-ssh - This command is used to execute Salt commands on remote hosts using SSH, without the need for a Salt Minion to be installed on the remote host.

salt-cloud - This command is used to provision and manage cloud resources, such as virtual machines or containers, using SaltStack.

salt-cp - This command is used to copy files to and from Salt Minions.

salt-doc - This command provides documentation for SaltStack modules, states, and other components.
