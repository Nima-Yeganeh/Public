# saltstack

SaltStack, also known as Salt, is an open-source infrastructure automation and configuration management tool. It allows system administrators to manage and configure large numbers of servers, network devices, and other IT assets using a declarative approach.

With SaltStack, administrators can define the desired state of their infrastructure, which can include everything from software configurations to system settings, and SaltStack will automatically ensure that the state is maintained across all devices in the environment. This makes it easier to manage and maintain a consistent configuration across a large number of servers or devices.

SaltStack uses a client-server architecture, where a central Salt master server communicates with Salt minions on each of the devices being managed. The Salt master sends commands to the minions, which then execute those commands on the devices they are running on.

SaltStack also includes a number of other features, such as event-driven automation, remote execution, and cloud orchestration, making it a powerful tool for managing complex IT environments.

SaltStack uses several ports for communication between Salt master and Salt minions. The default ports used by SaltStack are:
-   4505: This port is used for the Salt master to listen for incoming connections from Salt minions.
-   4506: This port is used for the Salt master to listen for encrypted connections from Salt minions.
It's worth noting that these port numbers can be customized in the SaltStack configuration files if needed. Additionally, SaltStack can also use other ports for specific features, such as the use of SSH for remote execution, which would require port 22 to be open on the remote host.

Here are some key terms related to SaltStack:

-   Salt Master: The Salt Master is the central server in the SaltStack architecture. It is responsible for managing the Salt minions and coordinating the configuration of the infrastructure.

-   Salt Minion: A Salt Minion is a client node that is managed by the Salt Master. It runs the SaltStack agent, which communicates with the Salt Master to receive configuration and execute commands.

-   States: States are declarative descriptions of the desired state of a Salt Minion or a group of Salt Minions. They define what packages, services, files, and other resources should be present or absent on a target system.

-   Grains: Grains are key-value pairs that describe various aspects of a Salt Minion, such as operating system, IP address, or memory usage. They can be used to target specific Salt Minions or groups of Salt Minions based on their characteristics.

-   Pillar: Pillar is a mechanism for storing sensitive or environment-specific data, such as passwords or database credentials, that can be accessed by Salt States.

-   Modules: Salt Modules are scripts or functions that can be executed on a Salt Minion to perform a specific task, such as installing a package or creating a user account.

-   SaltStack Event Bus: The SaltStack Event Bus is a system for sending and receiving event notifications throughout the Salt infrastructure. It can be used to trigger Salt States or execute other actions in response to events.

-   SaltStack Beacons: Beacons are background processes that monitor system events or resources, such as disk space or network connectivity, and trigger events on the Salt Event Bus.

-   Execution Modules: Execution modules are Salt modules that are designed to be run on the Salt Master, and not on Salt Minions. They are typically used for administrative tasks or for orchestrating complex operations across multiple Salt Minions.
