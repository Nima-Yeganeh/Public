Tips and Tricks of Ansible - Configuration management and automation tool

Sure, here are some tips and tricks for working with Ansible:

1. Use Ansible Vault: This is a built-in feature that allows you to encrypt your sensitive data such as private keys and passwords. This can be particularly helpful when storing information in a version control system.

2. Make use of Jinja2 templates: These templates are a powerful feature of Ansible that allow you to generate dynamic YAML configurations. This can be particularly helpful if you need to generate multiple configurations based on different variables.

3. Organize your inventory properly: A well-organized inventory is fundamental for proper use of Ansible. It is important to ensure that all hosts are grouped properly and that all variables are set correctly.

4. Document your Ansible playbook: It is important to make sure that all of your Ansible playbooks are well-documented. This can help you and other team members understand how your system is being configured.

5. Use dynamic inclusions: Dynamic inclusions can be useful when you want to include additional tasks or playbooks based on the outcome of certain tasks.

6. Use tags: You can use tags to group tasks together and execute only specific tasks. This can make playbook execution more efficient and quicker.

7. Keep your playbook clean: Make sure you write concise and clean playbooks, with easily-readable code. This will make it easier to maintain and troubleshoot errors.

8. Use Ansible Galaxy: Ansible Galaxy is a repository of pre-built Ansible roles that can be easily integrated into your playbooks. This can help speed up your development process.

Hope these tips help you to work better with Ansible!
