Here are some key terms related to SONET:

1. SONET: Synchronous Optical Network that provides a standardized transport mechanism for digital communication over optical fiber.

2. Optical Carrier (OC): A term used to classify the different transmission rates of SONET. For example, OC-1 operates at 51.84 Mbps and OC-192 operates at 9.95 Gbps.

3. Synchronous Transport Signal (STS): A standardized fixed-length signal used in SONET networks.

4. Payload: The user data carried by the SONET frame.

5. Overhead: The management and control data added to the SONET frame to ensure proper communication.

6. Multiplexing: The process of combining multiple signals into one signal for transmission.

7. Add/Drop Multiplexer (ADM): A device used to add or remove signals from a SONET ring.

8. Automatic Protection Switching (APS): A SONET feature that allows for fast recovery from network failures.
