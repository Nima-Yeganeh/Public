1. IP Address: A numerical label given to each device connected to the internet, which enables communication between devices.

2. Subnet Mask: A number that is used to determine which part of an IP address represents the network ID and which part represents the host ID.

3. Gateway: A device that acts as a bridge between different networks to allow communication between devices.

4. DNS Server: A server that translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing devices to connect to websites using easy-to-remember names instead of numerical IP addresses.

5. DHCP: A protocol that dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network, simplifying the network management process.

6. NAT: A technique that allows multiple devices on a network to share a single public IP address, providing added security and reducing the need for public IP addresses.

7. Routing: The process of directing network traffic between different networks and devices in order to ensure efficient communication.

8. Firewall: A security system that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic to block unwanted traffic and protect devices on a network from malicious attacks.
