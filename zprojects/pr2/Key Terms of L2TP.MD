The key terms of L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) include:

1. Tunnel – an encrypted connection established between two endpoints.

2. L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) – a network device that serves as a client to initiate the tunnel connection.

3. L2TP Network Server (LNS) – a network device that serves as a server to terminate the tunnel connection.

4. Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) – a security protocol used for authenticating clients and servers.

5. Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) – another security protocol that validates the identity of clients and servers by checking their usernames and passwords.

6. Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) – a protocol used to encapsulate the data within the tunnel.

7. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) – a transport protocol used to send and receive the L2TP packets over the network.

8. Internet Protocol (IP) – a network protocol that is used to route the data packets over the internet.
