Puppet is a configuration management tool that allows sysadmins to automate various IT tasks, including:

1. Manifests: These are written in a Ruby-based language, which defines the desired state of a system. Manifests are the building blocks of Puppet modules.

2. Modules: These are standalone units of configuration that contain code, files, templates, and other resources needed to manage a specific aspect of a system.

3. Resources: These are the basic building blocks of Puppet manifests, which describe the desired state of a resource, such as a file, package, or user account.

4. Nodes: These are the individual hosts or devices that are managed by Puppet.

5. Master: This is the central node that manages the configuration of all the nodes in the Puppet deployment.

6. Agent: This is the Puppet client that runs on each node and retrieves its configuration from the master.

7. Facts: These are variables that contain information about a node and its environment. Puppet uses facts to help determine the desired state of a resource on a node.

8. Catalogs: These are compiled versions of the Puppet manifests that are sent to each agent node, which describe the desired state of the resources on that node.
