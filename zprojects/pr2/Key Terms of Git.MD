1. Repository: A Git repository is a directory that stores your code and tracks changes made to it over time.

2. Commit: A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Each commit represents a set of changes made to your code.

3. Branch: A branch is a separate line of development that allows you to work on features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

4. Merge: Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. This is typically done to merge feature branches into the main codebase.

5. Pull Request: A Pull Request is a way to propose changes to a repository. It allows others to see the changes you've made and provide feedback before they are merged into the main codebase.

6. Fork: A fork is a copy of a repository. It allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original codebase.

7. Remote: A remote is a version of your repository that is hosted on a different server. This is typically used to collaborate with others on a team.
