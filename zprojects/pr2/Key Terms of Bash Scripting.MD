Here are some key terms of Bash scripting:

1. Bash: Stands for "Bourne-again shell". It is a command language interpreter that executes commands from the standard input or from a file.

2. Script: A script is a program written in Bash that contains a series of commands and instructions that are executed by the system's command-line interface.

3. Command: A single line of code executed by the shell. Commands can perform tasks such as printing text to the screen, running programs, or navigating files.

4. Variable: A named storage location that holds a value that can be changed during the execution of the script.

5. Quoting: Allows the use of special characters and spaces in command arguments, which would otherwise be interpreted by Bash.

6. Pipe: A method of connecting the output of one command to the input of another command using the "|" character.

7. Conditional statements: Statements that allow you to execute certain code blocks based on the evaluation of a condition.

8. Looping statements: Statements that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is met.

9. Function: A block of code that performs a single, specific task and can be reused throughout the script.

10. Comment: A line of text in a script that is ignored by Bash and serves as a note or explanation for the code.
