1. Hypervisor: Also known as a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), a hypervisor is a layer of software that enables multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) to run on a single physical host machine.

2. Virtual Machine (VM): A virtual machine is a software implementation of a computer system that runs on top of a hypervisor. It behaves like a separate physical machine and can run its own operating system and applications.

3. Host machine: The physical server or computer that runs the hypervisor layer and supports the virtual machines.

4. Guest machine: A virtual machine that runs on the host machine.

5. Cloud Computing: Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, software, analytics, and networking, over the Internet.

6. Containerization: Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization in which an application and its dependencies are packaged together in a container that can run on any system with a containerization platform, such as Docker.

7. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI): VDI is a method of running a desktop operating system and its applications in a virtual machine that runs on a data center server.

8. Virtual Networking: Virtual networking is the practice of creating a virtualized network infrastructure that can be used to connect between virtual machines, containers, or cloud instances.
