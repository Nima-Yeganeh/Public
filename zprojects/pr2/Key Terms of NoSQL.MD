NoSQL is a term used to describe a variety of non-relational databases that store and manage data in different ways than traditional relational databases. Here are some key terms related to NoSQL:

1. Document database: A NoSQL database that stores data in documents, typically using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (Extensible Markup Language) formats.

2. Key-value store: A type of NoSQL database that stores data as a key-value pair, similar to a dictionary or hash table.

3. Column-family store: A NoSQL database that stores data in columns rather than rows, allowing for faster access to specific data.

4. Graph database: A NoSQL database that uses graph structures to represent complex relationships between data.

5. eventually consistent: A NoSQL database consistency model where data changes are allowed to propagate eventually, rather than immediately. This model allows for greater scalability but may result in data inconsistencies.

6. CAP theorem: A concept in distributed computing that states that a distributed system can only provide two out of three guarantees: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. NoSQL databases typically prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency.

7. Sharding: The process of partitioning data across multiple servers in a distributed database system, allowing for greater scalability and performance.

8. MapReduce: A programming model used for processing and analyzing large data sets in a distributed environment. Many NoSQL databases support MapReduce processing.
