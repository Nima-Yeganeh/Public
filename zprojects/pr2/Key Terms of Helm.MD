Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that streamlines the installation and management of Kubernetes applications. Some key terms associated with Helm are:

1. Charts: Charts are packages that contain all the information required to install an application in Kubernetes using Helm. This includes container images, configuration settings, dependencies, and templates.

2. Repositories: Repositories are collections of Helm charts that can be used to install and manage Kubernetes applications. Repositories can be public or private, and they enable users to share and discover new charts.

3. Releases: A release is an instance of a chart installed in a Kubernetes cluster. Each release is identified by a unique name, and it can be upgraded, rolled back, or deleted using Helm commands.

4. Values: Values are configuration settings that can be customized when installing a chart. They allow users to provide specific values for parameters like instance count, container image names, and network settings.

5. Hooks: Hooks are scripts that are executed during different stages of the chart's lifecycle, such as before or after installation or upgrade. Hooks can be used to perform custom actions or validations.

6. Tiller: Tiller is the server-side component of Helm that manages the installation and lifecycle of charts in a Kubernetes cluster. Tiller communicates with the Kubernetes API server to create, update, and delete resources.
