CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is a network of servers distributed across different geographic locations. Some of the key terms associated with CDNs are:

1. Origin server: The origin server is the original source of the content that is being delivered. It is the server where the content is originally hosted.

2. Edge server: Also known as a point of presence (PoP), an edge server is part of the CDN infrastructure and is located at the edge of the network. It caches the content from the origin server, which enables faster delivery of the content to end-users.

3. Cache: A cache is a temporary storage location, often used to store frequently accessed data or content.

4. DNS: Domain Name System (DNS) is used to translate domain names into IP addresses. This is necessary for routing requests to the appropriate server.

5. Load balancing: Load balancing is the process of distributing traffic across multiple servers. This ensures that traffic is evenly distributed and reduces the load on individual servers.

6. SSL: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a protocol used to secure online communication. It ensures that all data exchanged between two communicating parties remain confidential and encrypted.
