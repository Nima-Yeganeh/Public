Apache is a widely-used web server software that has been popular for many years. Here are the advantages and disadvantages of using Apache:

Advantages:
1. Open-source: Apache is available as a free, open-source software, which means that you can use, modify, and distribute it without paying any licensing fees.
2. Cross-Platform: Apache runs on several operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and OS X.
3. Security: Apache is known for its robust security features and is constantly updated with the latest security patches to ensure a safe environment for hosting websites.
4. Scalability: Apache is designed to handle a large number of users and can easily scale to accommodate a growing number of visitors.
5. Customizable: Apache provides a wide range of configuration options, allowing you to customize the server to meet your specific needs.

Disadvantages:
1. Performance: Apache may not be the best option for high-performance websites that require fast loading times, as it can be slow when processing complex server-side scripts.
2. Complexity: Apache's configuration settings can be complex and difficult to understand for new users, particularly if you're not familiar with server administration.
3. Resource Usage: Apache requires a significant amount of resources and may not be the best option for websites with limited hosting resources.
4. Compatibility Issues: Some third-party applications may not work well with Apache, especially if they require specific server-side scripting support.
