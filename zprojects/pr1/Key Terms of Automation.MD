1. Robotics: The design, construction, and operation of robots.

2. Artificial Intelligence (AI): The simulation of human intelligence in machines, including tasks such as natural language processing, decision-making, and perception.

3. Machine Learning: A subset of AI that uses algorithms and statistical models to enable machines to improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed.

4. Process Automation: The automation of repetitive and rule-based tasks using software or applications.

5. Cognitive Automation: The automation of tasks that require human-like decision-making, interpretation, and communication skills.

6. Natural Language Processing (NLP): The ability of machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language.

7. Chatbots: Artificially intelligent digital assistants that can engage in human-like conversation with users through text or voice.

8. Internet of Things (IoT): A network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity, allowing them to exchange data.

9. Robotic Process Automation (RPA): The automation of business processes using robots or software bots.

10. DevOps: A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to streamline the software delivery process.
