1. Continuous Integration (CI) - The practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository to detect errors early.

2. Continuous Delivery (CD) - The process of automating the delivery of software to production by building, testing, and deploying code changes to environments.

3. Workflows - A configuration of jobs that define a sequence of steps to be performed in response to various events, such as code pushes or pull requests.

4. Pipelines - A set of actions that are executed in a defined sequence to build, test, and deploy code changes.

5. Jobs - A named set of steps that are executed in a separate environment, with outputs that can be passed between steps.

6. Artifacts - Any files or data that are produced during the build or test process, including logs, test results, and compiled binaries.

7. Orbs - A reusable package of CircleCI configuration that can be shared across organizations or projects, containing pre-built integrations, commands, and jobs.

8. Contexts - A secure way to store environment variables and other secrets, such as API keys, that can be accessed by jobs within a project.

9. Insights - A suite of dashboards and reports that provide real-time visibility into build performance, test results, and deployment status. 

10. Integrations - A variety of third-party tools that can be used to extend the functionality of CircleCI, including cloud providers, code repositories, and collaboration tools.
