There are several reasons why IT engineers should learn MongoDB:

1. Scalability: MongoDB is designed to handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally with ease. IT engineers will benefit from understanding how to manage and optimize a MongoDB database to meet the demands of their applications.

2. Flexibility: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is schemaless, giving developers and IT engineers flexible data modeling capabilities. This allows for faster iteration and evolution of data models throughout the life of an application.

3. High Availability: MongoDB provides fault tolerance, automated failover, and redundancy out of the box. IT engineers will learn how to set up and manage replicaset and sharding architectures to ensure high availability and reliability.

4. Real-time Analytics: MongoDB supports real-time analytics and reporting with its powerful Aggregation Framework. IT engineers can leverage this feature to extract insights and actionable data from their MongoDB data.

5. Widely Adopted: MongoDB has been adopted by major companies like GitHub, Expedia, and Forbes, and is widely used across industries. Learning MongoDB will give IT engineers a competitive edge in the current job market.
