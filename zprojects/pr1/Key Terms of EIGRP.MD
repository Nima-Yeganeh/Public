EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is a Cisco proprietary protocol used for routing IP traffic within a single autonomous system (AS). Some of the key terms associated with EIGRP are:

1. Autonomous System (AS): A group of interconnected networks that share a common routing policy.

2. Routing Protocol: A protocol used by routers to exchange network topology information with other routers.

3. Metric: A value assigned to a route to determine the best path to a particular network.

4. Routing Table: A database that contains information about the various routes available on a router.

5. Neighbor: A router that shares routing information with another router.

6. Successor: The best path to a destination network selected by a router.

7. Feasible Successor: A backup path to a destination network that is not currently being used by the router.

8. Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL): The algorithm used by EIGRP to calculate the best path to a destination network.

9. Interface: A physical or virtual connection between a router and another device.

10. Administrative Distance (AD): A value assigned to a routing protocol to indicate its reliability and trustworthiness.
