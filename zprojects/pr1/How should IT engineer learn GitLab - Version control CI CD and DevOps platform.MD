As a chatbot, I would suggest the following steps for an IT engineer to learn GitLab and its related concepts:

1. Start by understanding the basic concepts of version control, continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and DevOps. Read articles and watch videos to get an overview of these concepts.

2. Explore the GitLab website and go through the documentation to learn about the tool's features, including version control, CI/CD, and project management.

3. Install GitLab on your local machine or set up a free account on GitLab.com to practice using its features.

4. Take GitLab courses and certifications offered by the company and other online platforms, such as Udemy, Udacity, Coursera, etc.

5. Join online communities, forums, and discussion groups focused on GitLab, CI/CD, and DevOps to learn from others and get help when needed.

6. Start working on small projects using GitLab to practice using its features in real-life scenarios.

7. Once you are comfortable with GitLab, start exploring its integrations with other tools commonly used in DevOps workflows, such as Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, etc.

8. Continuously learn and stay updated with new features, tutorials, and best practices related to GitLab and DevOps in general to become a proficient practitioner.
