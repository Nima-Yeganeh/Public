Here are a few tips and tricks for network storage infrastructure:

1. Choose the right storage protocol: Make sure you select the appropriate storage protocol for your specific requirements. For instance, if you need high performance, go for iSCSI over NFS or SMB.

2. Prioritize data: Prioritize data based on criticality to ensure it is available whenever required. You can set up a tiered storage infrastructure where frequently accessed data is stored on high-performance storage and relatively less frequently accessed data is stored on lower performance storage.

3. Use deduplication and compression: Consider using data deduplication and compression to save storage space and reduce costs. This can be they key in increasing storage capacity.

4. Ensure security: Implement proper security measures to safeguard sensitive data. Ensure that proper access rights are assigned to users based on their roles.

5. Monitor and manage storage effectively: Regularly monitor and manage your storage infrastructure to ensure that it's running efficiently. Set up alerts and notifications to identify and address any potential issues early on.

6. Have a backup and disaster recovery plan: Have a backup and disaster recovery plan in place to make sure that data is not lost in case of any unforeseen disruptions. Test the backup and disaster recovery plan regularly to ensure its effectiveness.

By following these tips, you can ensure that your network storage infrastructure is efficient, secure, and reliable.
