Sure, below are some useful tips and tricks for using VMware:

1. Take advantage of snapshots: Snapshots allow you to take a snapshot of the current state of a virtual machine, which you can revert back to if necessary. This is useful for testing, debugging, and making changes to a machine without worrying about breaking it.

2. Use templates: Templates are pre-built virtual machine configurations that can be used to quickly spin up new machines. This saves time and ensures consistency across your virtual infrastructure.

3. Use customization specifications: Customization specifications allow you to automate the process of configuring new virtual machines. You can use these to set network settings, passwords, and other configuration options.

4. Monitor and optimize performance: VMware provides a variety of performance monitoring tools to help you identify and resolve performance issues. Ensure that you regularly monitor the virtual machine's CPU, memory, and disk usage to optimize performance.

5. Use vMotion: vMotion allows you to move virtual machines between physical servers without downtime. This is extremely useful for maintaining high availability and load balancing across your virtual infrastructure.

6. Keep your software up to date: Always keep your VMware software up to date to ensure that you have access to the latest features and security updates.

7. Utilize third-party tools: There are a variety of third-party tools available that can help you get more out of your virtual infrastructure. Check out tools like Veeam, Solarwinds, and ManageEngine for additional features and functionality.
