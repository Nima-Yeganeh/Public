SONET, short for Synchronous Optical Network, is a standardized technology used in telecommunications networks for high-speed transmission of data over fiber optic infrastructure. Some key terms associated with SONET include:

1. SONET Frame: A SONET Frame is a standardized format for transmitting data over optical networks. The frame is made up of overhead and payload information, where payload information is the actual user data being transmitted.

2. OC-N: OC-N refers to the Optical Carrier level, where N is an integer representing the transmission rate of the SONET network. For example, OC-3, OC-12, OC-48, and OC-192 are common OC-N levels for SONET networks.

3. STS: STS stands for Synchronous Transport Signal and refers to the payload information in a SONET Frame. STS-1 is the basic building block of a SONET Frame and carries data at a rate of 51.84 Mbps.

4. Multiplexing: SONET allows for the multiplexing of multiple lower-speed signals into a higher-speed signal, allowing for efficient transmission and use of fiber optic infrastructure.

5. Network Elements: SONET networks consist of several network elements, including Add/Drop Multiplexers (ADMs), Repeater Huts, Regenerators, and Digital Cross-connect Systems (DCS). These elements help ensure reliable and efficient data transmission over the network.
