1. Fiber-Optic Cable: A cable consisting of one or more strands of glass or plastic that carry data signals using light waves.

2. Single-Mode Fiber: A type of fiber-optic cable in which signals travel in a single beam of light, allowing for longer distances and higher bandwidths.

3. Multi-Mode Fiber: A type of fiber-optic cable in which signals travel through multiple beams of light simultaneously, allowing for shorter distances and lower bandwidths.

4. Optical Transmitter: A device that converts an electrical signal into an optical signal for transmission over fiber-optic cable.

5. Optical Receiver: A device that converts an optical signal into an electrical signal for processing.

6. Fiber-Optic Connector: A device used to join two fiber-optic cables together.

7. Fiber-Optic Splice: The process of joining two fiber-optic cables together permanently.

8. Fiber-Optic Amplifier: A device that boosts the strength of an optical signal to overcome signal loss due to distance.

9. Fiber-Optic Switch: A device used to route data signals from one fiber-optic cable to another. 

10. Optical Loss: The reduction in signal strength that occurs as light travels through a fiber-optic cable due to absorption, scattering, and other factors.
