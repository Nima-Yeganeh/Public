1. Azure DevOps: A cloud-based platform built on Microsoft Azure that provides end-to-end toolchain for continuous integration, delivery, and deployment (CI/CD) of software applications.

2. Continuous Integration (CI): A software development practice in which developers frequently integrate their code changes into a central repository. CI helps teams to detect defects and fix them quickly.

3. Continuous Delivery (CD): A software development practice in which code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to a production environment. CD ensures that code changes are delivered more frequently to the customers.

4. Pipelines: A collection of stages and tasks that define how code is built, tested, and deployed. Pipelines are created in Azure DevOps and can be triggered automatically or manually.

5. Repositories: A place where code is stored and managed. Azure DevOps provides Git and TFVC (Team Foundation Version Control) as the repository options.

6. Builds: A process of compiling the code and generating an executable or installable file. Builds can be triggered automatically or manually in Azure DevOps.

7. Tests: A process of validating code changes to ensure that they meet the expected functionality and quality. Tests can be automated or manual.

8. Artifacts: Generated files such as binaries, packages or other artifacts that can be deployed or released.

9. Agents: A software component installed on build or deployment servers used by Azure DevOps to execute tasks, such as builds or deployment.

10. Environments: Target environments, such as development, testing, staging or production, to which code changes are deployed.
