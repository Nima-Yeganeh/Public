QoS (Quality of Service) refers to the ability of a network to provide different levels of priority to different types of network traffic. Here are some key terms related to QoS:

1. Bandwidth - The amount of data that can be transmitted over a network in a given time.

2. Latency - The delay that occurs in the transmission of data over a network.

3. Jitter - The variation in delay that can occur when transmitting data over a network.

4. Packet Loss - The loss of data packets during transmission over a network.

5. Traffic Shaping - The process of limiting or shaping network traffic to prioritize certain types of traffic over others.

6. Congestion Control - The process of managing network traffic to prevent congestion and ensure smooth data transmission.

7. Priority Queuing - The process of assigning priority levels to different types of network traffic to ensure high-priority traffic is transmitted first.

8. Class of Service (CoS) - A method of identifying and marking different types of network traffic to prioritize them based on their importance.
