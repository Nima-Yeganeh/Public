Here are some key terms of Bash scripting:

1. Bash: It stands for Bourne-Again SHell, which is a command processor and scripting language.

2. Script: A script is a set of instructions, written in a programming language, to be executed by the computer.

3. Command-line interface (CLI): A way of interacting with a computer by typing commands as text rather than using a graphical user interface.

4. Variable: A variable is a symbol or name that represents a value, which can be changed during the execution of a script.

5. Conditional statements: Conditional statements allow a script to make decisions based on the values of variables or other conditions.

6. Loops: Loops are used to repeat a set of statements a number of times, or until a certain condition is met.

7. Functions: Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

8. Standard Input (stdin), Standard Output (stdout), and Standard Error (stderr): These are the standard communication channels between a script and a user or another program. STDIN is used to send input to a program, STDOUT is used for normal program output, and STDERR is used for error messages.
