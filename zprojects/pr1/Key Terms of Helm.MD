Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows you to easily install, update, and manage applications and services on a Kubernetes cluster. Here are some key terms related to Helm:

1. Chart: A Helm package that contains all the information necessary to create a Kubernetes application. A chart includes templates, values, and settings for creating Kubernetes resources.

2. Release: A running instance of a chart that has been installed on a Kubernetes cluster by Helm. A release includes a set of resources that have been created based on the chart.

3. Repository: A collection of charts that can be used with Helm. Helm provides a default repository, but you can also create your own.

4. Values: Configuration settings that are used to customize a chart. Values can be defined in a values file or passed in at install time.

5. Template: A file that defines the Kubernetes resources to be created. Templates can include placeholders for values and can be customized in various ways.

6. Dependency: A chart that is required by another chart in order to run. Helm manages dependencies automatically when you install a chart.
