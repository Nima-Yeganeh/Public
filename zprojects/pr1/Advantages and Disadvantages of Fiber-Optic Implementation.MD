Advantages of Fiber-Optic Implementation:

1. Faster Data Transfer Rates: Fiber optics can transmit data over long distances at a faster rate compared to copper cables.

2. Immunity to Electromagnetic Interference: Fiber optics are immune to electromagnetic interference, which can degrade the quality of signals transmitted over copper cables.

3. Long Transmission Distances: Light signals can be transmitted over long distances over fiber-optic cables without the need for signal boosters.

4. Lower Signal Attenuation: The attenuation rate of light signals over fiber-optic cables is much lower than that over copper cables, meaning that it can transmit data over longer distances with minimal signal loss.

5. Security: Fiber-optic cables are difficult to tap, making them more secure than copper cables.

Disadvantages of Fiber-Optic Implementation:

1. Initial Installation Costs: Fiber-optic cables can be more expensive to install compared to traditional copper cables.

2. Vulnerability to Physical Damage: Fiber optic cabling is physically more fragile and can be easily damaged, which may result in high maintenance costs.

3. Limited Support of Legacy Devices: Many legacy devices do not support fiber-optic connections.

4. Limited Availability: Fiber-optic connections may not be available in all areas.

5. Expertise Required for Installation and Maintenance: Installing and maintaining fiber-optic connections requires specialized expertise, which may be difficult to find.
