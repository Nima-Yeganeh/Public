1. Familiarize yourself with the CircleCI Documentation: The official CircleCI documentation is the starting point for learning the platform. It provides step-by-step guides, tutorials, and examples of how to set up and use the platform.

2. Practice with the Examples: CircleCI provides many examples of how to use the platform on Github. You can clone the examples and run them locally to get a better understanding of how CircleCI works.

3. Join the CircleCI Community: The CircleCI community has many resources that can help you learn and connect with fellow users. You can participate in forums, Slack channels, or webinars to get answers to your questions and learn from others' experiences.

4. Experiment with Your Own Projects: Start using CircleCI with your own projects. This will help you learn the practical aspects of configuring jobs, workflows, and pipelines.

5. Attend Workshops and Meetups: CircleCI frequently conducts workshops, webinars, and meetups. Attending such events can be a great way to learn from experts and other users.
