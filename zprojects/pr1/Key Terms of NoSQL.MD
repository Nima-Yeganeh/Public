NoSQL stands for "not only SQL" and encompasses a wide range of non-relational data management systems. Here are some key terms related to NoSQL:

1. Document database: A type of database that stores semi-structured data as documents, usually in JSON or XML format.

2. Key-value database: A type of database that stores data as key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value.

3. Columnar database: A type of database that stores data in columns rather than rows, allowing for efficient data retrieval and storage.

4. Graph database: A type of database that stores data as nodes and edges, allowing for efficient traversal of complex relationships between data.

5. CAP theorem: A principle in distributed computing that states that a distributed system can only guarantee two of the following: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

6. Sharding: A technique used in distributed databases to partition data across multiple nodes, allowing for increased scalability and performance.

7. ACID: A set of properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. NoSQL databases typically sacrifice some or all of these properties for increased scalability and performance.
