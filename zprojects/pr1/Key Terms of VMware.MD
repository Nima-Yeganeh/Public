1. Hypervisor: A layer of software that enables multiple virtual machines to run on a physical host.

2. Virtual Machine (VM): An emulation of a computer system that runs on a physical host machine.

3. vSphere: A suite of virtualization and cloud computing management products from VMware.

4. ESXi: The hypervisor that runs on the physical host and manages the virtual machines.

5. vCenter Server: A centralized management tool that enables administrators to manage multiple ESXi hosts and virtual machines.

6. vMotion: A feature that allows live migration of a running virtual machine from one physical host to another without service interruption.

7. Storage vMotion: A feature that allows live migration of a virtual machine’s storage from one storage device to another without service interruption.

8. High Availability (HA): A feature that enables virtual machines to be automatically restarted on another host in the event of a host failure.

9. Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS): A feature that automatically balances the resources (CPU and memory) of virtual machines across a cluster of ESXi hosts.

10. Fault Tolerance (FT): A feature that provides continuous availability for virtual machines in the event of a host failure by creating a real-time replica of the virtual machine on another ESXi host.
