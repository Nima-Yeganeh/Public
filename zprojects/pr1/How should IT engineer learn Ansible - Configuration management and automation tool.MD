There are multiple ways for an IT engineer to learn Ansible as a configuration management and automation tool. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Start with the official Ansible documentation: The official documentation is an excellent place to start. The documentation provides a comprehensive overview of Ansible, including installation and configuration, creating inventories, and writing simple playbooks.

2. Attend training courses: Several training courses teach Ansible, ranging from in-person classes to online courses. These training courses offer hands-on lab environments and instructors' expertise to guide the IT engineer through Ansible usage.

3. Participate in Ansible communities: Ansible has a giant community of developers and users who are always willing to help learners solve their problems. Joining the Ansible community forums, mailing lists, and chat rooms can help learn from experts, get answers to questions, and share experiences.

4. Practice with real-world scenarios: Using real-world scenarios to practice will help develop hands-on experience with Ansible's capabilities. Try creating more complex playbooks to automate multiple server configuration and deploy complex applications.

5. Collaborate with other engineers: Collaborating with other engineers helps to learn different perspectives, ideas, and challenges in using Ansible. Through collaborative learning, one can explore different scenarios that can expand Ansible skills.
