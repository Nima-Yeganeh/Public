1. Puppet Master: The primary node or server that runs the Puppet master service and acts as a central configuration point for all the nodes in a network.

2. Puppet Agent: The client node that is installed on each machine in a network and communicates with the Puppet master to maintain the desired configuration state.

3. Manifests: The code written in the Puppet language that describes the desired configuration for a group of nodes. 

4. Modules: Pre-packaged code in the Puppet language that can be easily imported into manifests to simplify coding and reuse.

5. Facts: Data about a node that is collected and sent to the Puppet master by the Puppet agent. This data can be used to dynamically generate manifests.

6. Resources: The building blocks of Puppet manifests that represent a specific configuration item, such as a service, file, or package.

7. Catalog: A compiled version of manifests and resources that is generated by the Puppet master and sent to each Puppet agent. 

8. Hiera: A configuration data management tool used to store and retrieve data from external sources like YAML files, databases, or APIs.

9. PuppetDB: A Puppet module that provides a centralized database for storing inventory and configuration data that can be used by other tools for reporting or analysis.
