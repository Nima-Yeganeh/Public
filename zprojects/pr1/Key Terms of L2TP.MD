L2TP, which stands for Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol, is a VPN protocol that enables secure data transfer between remote devices. Some of the key terms related to L2TP are:

1. Tunneling: This refers to the process of encapsulating one type of protocol within another. In the case of L2TP, it encapsulates PPP traffic within L2TP packets.

2. Encapsulation: This refers to the process of adding an additional header and trailer to the original data, which allows it to be transmitted over the internet.

3. Session: A session is established between the two devices once a connection has been made. This session remains active throughout the connection.

4. Authentication: L2TP supports authentication through the use of various protocols such as PAP and CHAP.

5. Encryption: L2TP provides data encryption using IPsec, which ensures that the data transmitted across the network is secure and private.

6. Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP): PPP is a communication protocol used to establish a direct connection between two nodes over a serial line.
