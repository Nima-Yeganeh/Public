Routing: The process of identifying the path for transmitting data packets across a network.

Routing algorithm: A method of computing the optimal path for data packets to reach their destination.

Routing table: A database that contains information about the available network paths, used by routers to determine the best path for forwarding packets.

Hop count: The number of intermediary networks that a packet passes through on its way to the destination network.

Routing metrics: The criteria used to determine the best path for packets based on factors such as cost, speed, reliability, and congestion.

Routing protocol: A set of rules that routers use to communicate with each other and exchange information about network topology and available routes.

Static routing: Manual configuration of routing table entries by a network administrator.

Dynamic routing: Automatic routing table updates facilitated by routing protocols based on changes in network topology or traffic congestion.

Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP): A routing protocol used to exchange routing information between routers within a single autonomous system.

Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP): A routing protocol used to exchange routing information between routers in different autonomous systems.
