Advantages of Terraform:
1. Infrastructure as Code: Terraform allows you to define infrastructure as code. This means you can represent your entire infrastructure stack in code.

2. Multi-Cloud Support: It supports multiple cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more. 

3. Modular Architecture: Terraform has a modular architecture that allows you to reuse code and create different modules that can be applied to different infrastructure environments.

4. Plan and Apply Features: Terraform has a plan and apply feature that lets you preview the changes that will be made to your infrastructure before they are applied.

5. Easy to Use: Terraform is easy to install and use, and its syntax is simple and easy to understand.

Disadvantages of Terraform:
1. Learning Curve: Terraform has a bit of a learning curve, especially for those who are new to infrastructure as code.

2. Limited Support for Some Platforms: While Terraform supports multiple cloud platforms, the coverage may not be as extensive as other tools.

3. Complexity: Terraform can sometimes be complex, especially when dealing with complex infrastructure environments.

4. Version Compatibility: Terraform is versioned, and sometimes upgrades can break compatibility for users working with a previous version.

5. Debugging: It may sometimes be challenging to debug issues with Terraform code, especially as the infrastructure grows in complexity.
