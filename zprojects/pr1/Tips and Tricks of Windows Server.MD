Some tips and tricks for Windows Server include:

1. Regular updates: Ensure that the Windows Server is updated regularly to protect against vulnerabilities and bugs.

2. Use Server Manager: The Server Manager tool is a powerful management tool that can help you monitor and manage server roles, features and performance.

3. Security: Set up strong passwords, enable security policies, disable unnecessary services, and use firewalls to lock down your server.

4. Remote access: Use Remote Desktop Connection or Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT) to manage the server remotely.

5. PowerShell: PowerShell is a powerful command-line tool that can be used to automate repetitive tasks and manage your Windows Server.

6. Backup and Restore: Set up regular backups of your server data, and know how to quickly restore data in case of a disaster.

7. Monitoring Performance: Use Performance Monitor to track key statistics about the server, such as CPU usage, disk usage, and network activity, to help identify performance bottlenecks and potential issues.

8. Virtualization: Consider using Hyper-V, a built-in virtualization technology, to create and manage virtual machines on your server, allowing you to run multiple operating systems on the same hardware.
