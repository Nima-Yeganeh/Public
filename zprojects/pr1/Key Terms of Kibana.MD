1. Elasticsearch: Kibana is built on top of Elasticsearch, a distributed search and analytics engine.

2. Index: An index is a collection of documents that have similar characteristics. In Elasticsearch, an index is composed of one or more shards, which are the basic building blocks of Elasticsearch.

3. Dashboard: A dashboard is a collection of visualizations, searches, and other Kibana elements that have been arranged into a single view.

4. Visualization: A visualization is a graphical representation of data. Kibana offers many different types of visualizations, including line, bar, and pie charts, as well as maps and tables.

5. Query: A query is a search request in Elasticsearch, used to retrieve data based on specific criteria.

6. Filter: A filter is used to narrow down the scope of a search, by specifying certain criteria that must be met. Filters can be applied to specific fields or across the entire index.

7. Aggregation: Aggregations are used to summarize data in Elasticsearch, by grouping data together and performing calculations on the groups. Kibana offers many different types of aggregations, including average, sum, and min/max.
