Here are some tips and tricks for working with Microsoft SQL:

1. Use the right data types: Make sure to choose the appropriate data type for each column. Choosing the wrong data type could lead to slower performance and wasted storage.

2. Use indexes: Indexes can greatly improve the performance of queries by allowing SQL Server to quickly locate the rows that match a particular condition.

3. Use stored procedures: Using stored procedures can improve performance and security by allowing you to execute a pre-written block of code instead of re-writing code for each query.

4. Use transactions: Transactions allow you to group multiple SQL statements into a single unit of work, ensuring that all statements are completed or rolled back if an error occurs.

5. Use query hints: Query hints can be used to instruct SQL Server to use a particular execution plan or to perform certain optimizations.

6. Monitor performance: Use SQL Server's performance monitoring tools to identify bottlenecks and optimize your queries.

7. Optimize your queries: Make sure your SQL queries are optimized for performance by using the appropriate indexes, limiting the number of rows returned, and avoiding joins and subqueries when possible.

8. Keep your database tidy: Regularly clean up your database by removing unnecessary data and optimizing indexes to improve performance.

9. Use backup and recovery strategies: Ensure that you have a reliable backup and recovery strategy in place to protect your data in case of data loss or corruption.

10. Stay up-to-date: Keep up-to-date with the latest SQL Server updates and patches to ensure that your database is secure and performing at its best.
