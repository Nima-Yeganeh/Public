Segment Routing (SR) is a networking technology that provides a simpler, more scalable, and more flexible way to steer traffic through a network. Some key terms used in Segment Routing include:

1. Segment: A segment is a unique identifier that represents a specific instruction for a packet to follow as it traverses the network. Segments can be represented by various types of headers, such as IPv6 or MPLS.

2. Node: A node is a device in the network that can participate in Segment Routing. Nodes can be routers, switches, or other types of network devices.

3. Label: In Segment Routing with MPLS, a label is a short identifier that is used to identify the next segment in a path. Labels are added to packets as they traverse the network.

4. Locator: A locator is the network address of a node that is used to route packets to that node. In Segment Routing with IPv6, the Locator is the IPv6 address of the next hop.

5. Path: A path is a sequence of segments that a packet follows as it traverses the network. Paths can be pre-defined or dynamically computed based on network conditions.

6. Traffic Engineering: Traffic Engineering is the process of optimizing network traffic flows to achieve specific performance objectives, such as reducing delay, jitter or packet loss. Segment Routing enables Traffic Engineering by allowing packets to follow specific paths through the network.
