Sure, here are some tips and tricks for Nginx:

1. Use include files: Instead of storing all of your configuration in a single file, you can break it into smaller sections using include files. This makes it easier to manage and update your configuration.

2. Enable caching: Nginx can cache frequently accessed files, which can improve website performance. You can enable caching by adding the following configuration to your Nginx configuration file: 

```
proxy_cache_path /path/to/cache levels=1:2 keys_zone=my_cache:10m inactive=60m;
```

3. Use server blocks: Nginx allows you to set up multiple server blocks, each with its own configuration settings. This is useful if you’re running multiple websites on the same server.

4. Set up HTTP/2: HTTP/2 is a newer version of the HTTP protocol that reduces latency and improves website speed. You can enable HTTP/2 in Nginx by adding the following configuration to your server block:

```
listen 443 ssl http2;
```

5. Use Nginx as a load balancer: Nginx can be used as a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. You can set up load balancing by creating an upstream block with the servers you want to load balance, then adding a proxy_pass statement to your server block:

```
upstream my_servers {
    server 192.168.1.100;
    server 192.168.1.101;
}
server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://my_servers;
    }
}
```

These are just a few tips and tricks for Nginx, but they can help you get the most out of this powerful web server.
