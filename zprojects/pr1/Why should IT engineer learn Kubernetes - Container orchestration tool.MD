There are several reasons why IT engineers should learn Kubernetes as a container orchestration tool. 

1. Scalability: Kubernetes allows you to easily scale your containerized applications up or down based on demand. With Kubernetes, you can automatically adjust the number of containers you need to handle the traffic load, ensuring the application performance and availability.

2. Flexibility and Portability: Kubernetes provides a flexible platform that can run anywhere, from public clouds like AWS, Azure to on-premises data centers. Kubernetes allows you to manage your infrastructure using a single platform, making it easy to move your applications across different environments.

3. Resource Efficiency: Kubernetes makes efficient use of computing resources by automatically scheduling containers based on resource requirements such as CPU and memory usage. This ensures that your applications run smoothly without any resource contention issues.

4. High Availability: Kubernetes ensures high availability of your applications and data. Its ability to automatically restart containers when they fail, creates a reliable environment for your applications.

5. Cost Savings: Kubernetes enables your organization to lower costs by optimizing resource utilization, reducing time and effort in deploying and updating applications, and supporting multiple cloud or on-premises platforms.

Overall, learning Kubernetes can help IT engineers to efficiently manage containerized applications in a distributed environment, save costs, and deliver reliable services with high levels of availability, flexibility and portability.
