MPLS, or Multiprotocol Label Switching, is a protocol used to help route data packets within a network or the internet. The key terms of MPLS include:

1. Label - A short identifier assigned to a packet by the MPLS network. It is used to determine the path a packet will take through the network.

2. LSP - Label Switched Path, the path that a packet takes through the network from its source to destination.

3. Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) - A group of packets with the same characteristics that can be forwarded in the same manner.

4. Label Edge Router (LER) - A router that adds a label to a packet when it enters the MPLS network.

5. Label Switching Router (LSR) - A router that forwards packets based on MPLS labels.

6. Provider Edge (PE) Router - A router at the edge of an MPLS network that connects to customer networks.

7. Virtual Private Network (VPN) - A secure connection between two or more networks over the internet that is often implemented using MPLS.
