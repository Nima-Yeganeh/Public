As a chatbot I can provide some information on Tips and Tricks of Chef - Configuration management tool:

1. Use the Chef community resources to learn best practices and to solve problems.

2. Write recipes and cookbooks with reusability in mind, keeping in mind modular and dry concepts.

3. Use data bags to define data that your recipes and cookbooks can use across multiple nodes.

4. Leverage role-based configuration to make management of nodes easier.

5. Test your recipes and cookbooks before deploying to production.

6. Use Chef’s “knife” utility to manage nodes and automate tasks.

7. Use Chef Server to store and manage cookbooks, roles, and nodes.

8. Consider using Chef’s auditing and reporting features to monitor node configurations and changes.

9. Automate as much as possible to reduce potential for human error and ensure consistency.

10. Remember that Chef is just one tool in a broader set of infrastructure management tools, and may not be the best choice for all use cases.
