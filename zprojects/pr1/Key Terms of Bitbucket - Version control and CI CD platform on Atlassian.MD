1. Version control: Bitbucket is a platform that provides version control for software development teams. This allows developers to track changes to their code and collaborate on projects.

2. Repositories: Bitbucket hosts repositories (or repos) where developers can store and organize their code. Repositories can be private or public, and can be accessed via various protocols such as HTTPS, SSH or GIT.

3. Git: Bitbucket uses Git as its primary version control system. Git is an open-source distributed version control system that enables developers to manage code changes at a granular level.

4. Pull requests: Pull requests are a key feature of Bitbucket that enable developers to submit changes to a repository and request that they be merged into the codebase. Pull requests facilitate code reviews and help ensure that changes are thoroughly tested before they're merged into the codebase.

5. Branching: Bitbucket enables developers to create branches, or copies of a repository, to work on separate features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Branching enables developers to work concurrently and independently on multiple features or bug fixes.

6. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD): Bitbucket provides built-in CI/CD tools that enable teams to automate the testing, building, and deployment of their code. This helps to ensure that code changes are thoroughly tested before being deployed to production environments.

7. Pipelines: Pipelines is Bitbucket's CI/CD tool that helps developers automate the software delivery process. Pipelines enables developers to build, test, and deploy their code with a single, unified tool.

8. Integrations: Bitbucket integrates with a range of third-party tools and services, such as JIRA (Atlassian's issue tracking and project management software) and Slack (a team collaboration tool). These integrations help teams streamline their workflows and collaborate more effectively.
