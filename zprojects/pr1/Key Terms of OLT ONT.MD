OLT (Optical Line Terminal) and ONT (Optical Network Terminal) are key terms used in fiber-optic communication technology. 

OLT: 

An OLT is a device that is installed at the service provider's premises at the beginning of a fiber-optic network to manage the data transmitted over the network. An OLT transmits data from multiple customers' ONTs over a single fiber and routes it toward the internet or other destination. 

ONT: 

An ONT is a device that is installed at the customer's premises at the end of a fiber-optic network. It acts as a modem that can translate the fiber-optic signal into Ethernet signals the customer's devices can use. An ONT also receives signals from a customer's devices and sends them over the fiber-optic network to the service provider's OLT. ONTs typically have multiple Ethernet ports, so they can act as a hub for all of a customer's wired devices.
