BFD, or Bidirectional Forwarding Detection, is a protocol used in computer networking to detect faults in the forwarding path between two forwarding engines. Some key terms related to BFD include:

1. Forwarding engine: A device that forwards packets in a network, such as a router or switch.

2. Detection time: The time it takes for the BFD protocol to detect a fault in the forwarding path between two forwarding engines.

3. Control packet: A packet sent by the BFD protocol to detect faults in the forwarding path.

4. Session: A logical connection created between two forwarding engines for BFD communication.

5. Discriminator: A value used to uniquely identify a BFD session.

6. Echo function: A feature of BFD that sends a periodic echo packet to test connectivity between forwarding engines.
