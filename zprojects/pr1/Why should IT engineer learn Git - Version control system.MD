IT engineers should learn Git - version control system because it is a widely used and industry-standard tool for managing source code and collaborating on projects. With Git, engineers can easily track changes made to code, revert to previous versions when necessary, and work simultaneously on the same codebase with other team members. It also facilitates collaboration by providing a platform for developers to fork, merge, and review code changes. Learning Git - version control system is an essential skill for IT engineers who want to work in software development production and delivery processes.
