3. Plugin: A program or script that performs the actual monitoring of a host or service.

4. Check: The act of executing a plugin against a host or service to gather monitoring data.

5. Event: A notification generated by Nagios indicating a change in the state of a monitored host or service.

6. Notification: An alert sent by Nagios to notify system administrators or other stakeholders of an event.

7. State: The current status of a monitored host or service, which can be up (running normally), down (not responding), or in a warning or critical state due to a threshold being exceeded.

8. Threshold: A user-defined limit or threshold that, when exceeded, triggers a warning or critical state.

9. Flapping: A condition where the state of a host or service oscillates rapidly between up and down states, causing frequent notifications.

10. Passive checks: Monitoring data sent to Nagios by external systems, rather than actively checked by Nagios through a plugin.
