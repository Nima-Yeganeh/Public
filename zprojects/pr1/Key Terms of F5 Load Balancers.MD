1. Load Balancing: The process of distributing network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal performance and availability.

2. Persistence: The ability of a load balancer to keep a user's session or connection with a specific server even after the user has left or disconnected.

3. SSL Offloading: A process where a load balancer terminates SSL traffic from users and re-encrypts it to send it to the backend servers.

4. Health Monitoring: The process of regularly checking the status of servers and applications to ensure they are operating correctly.

5. Traffic Manipulation: The ability of a load balancer to manipulate traffic based on various factors, such as geographic location or request type.

6. Content Switching: The process of directing traffic requests to specific servers or applications based on factors such as user location, device type, or content type.

7. Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB): The ability of a load balancer to redirect traffic to geographically dispersed servers based on user location, server availability, or other factors.

8. Layer 4 vs. Layer 7: Layer 4 load balancing distributes traffic at the transport layer (TCP/UDP), while Layer 7 load balancing operates at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS) and offers additional features such as content-based routing and SSL offloading.
