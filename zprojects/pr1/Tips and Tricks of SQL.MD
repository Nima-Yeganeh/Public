Sure, here are some tips and tricks for SQL:

1. Use indexes: Adding indexes to your queries can greatly improve performance. However, be careful not to over-index as it can slow down data modifications.

2. Utilize joins: Joins are used to combine data from different tables. Use INNER JOIN to retrieve matching records from both tables and OUTER JOIN to retrieve all records from both tables.

3. Minimize the use of subqueries: Subqueries can decrease performance. Instead, use JOINs or temporary tables to achieve the same results.

4. Use aliases: Aliases can help make your queries more readable. Use abbreviations for longer table or column names.

5. Use GROUP BY with aggregate functions: GROUP BY is used to group data by one or more columns. When used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM or AVG, it can return summary information for each group.

6. Beware of NULL values: NULL values can cause unexpected results when using functions like COUNT and AVG. Use IS NULL and IS NOT NULL to avoid any problems.

7. Use the right data types: Make sure you choose the right data types for your columns to optimize storage and performance.

8. Test your queries: Always test your SQL queries on sample data before executing them on your actual database.

Hope that helps!
