There are a variety of tips and tricks for designing and implementing effective datacenter services. Here are a few key considerations:

1. Scalability - When designing a datacenter service, it's important to ensure that it can accommodate future growth and increased demand.

2. Redundancy - Make sure the datacenter service is designed with redundancy so that if one component fails, another can take over.

3. Security - Datacenter services are a frequent target for cyber attacks, so it's important to implement security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and multi-factor authentication.

4. Efficient cooling and power management - Datacenters consume a lot of power, so it's important to design services with efficient cooling and power management to reduce energy consumption and minimize costs.

5. Standards compliance - Industry standards such as ISO 27001 or SOC 2 Type 2 can help ensure that the service is designed and implemented with best practices in mind.

6. Testing and monitoring - Once the datacenter service is implemented, it's important to regularly test and monitor it to ensure that it's functioning optimally and to identify and resolve issues as quickly as possible. 

7. Disaster recovery - It is important to have a disaster recovery plan in place to be prepared for an unexpected outage or event. This includes regular backups, data replication, and procedures for failover and disaster recovery.
