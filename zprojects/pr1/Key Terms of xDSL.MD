xDSL refers to a family of technologies that provide digital data transmission over twisted pair telephone lines, and includes several different variants, including:

1. ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) - This technology allows for faster download speeds than upload speeds, and is commonly used by residential customers for internet access.

2. VDSL (Very High Bitrate Digital Subscriber Line) - This technology is capable of providing faster speeds than ADSL in both directions, and is often used by businesses and enterprises.

3. SDSL (Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line) - This technology offers equal upload and download speeds, allowing for tasks such as video conferencing and file sharing to be carried out more efficiently.

4. HDSL (High-Bitrate Digital Subscriber Line) - This technology is designed for applications that require high bandwidth and reliability, such as connecting LANs between buildings or campuses.

5. G.SHDSL (Symmetric High-Bitrate Digital Subscriber Line) - This technology is similar to SDSL, but offers higher data rates and longer distances.

Other key terms associated with xDSL include modulation, attenuation, and loop length, which all impact the performance and speed of the technology.
