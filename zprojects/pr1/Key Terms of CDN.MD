1. Content Delivery Network (CDN): A distributed network infrastructure that accelerates the delivery of website content by deploying servers in strategic locations globally.

2. Edge locations: The points of presence (PoP) around the world where CDN nodes/cache servers are located. These locations store cached content, and they are responsible for delivering that content directly to users.

3. Origin server: The original source of the website content that is being served.

4. Cache/Cache server: A server that stores a cached version of the website content, and it is used to deliver the content to the users quickly.

5. Cache hit/miss: When a user requests a piece of content, it is either served from the cache as a hit or retrieved from the origin server as a miss.

6. DNS (Domain Name System) server: A system responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses. A CDN uses multiple DNS servers to route user requests to the nearest edge location.

7. SSL/TLS: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are cryptographic protocols used to secure data transmitted over the internet. A CDN can offer SSL/TLS certificates to secure website content in transit.

8. Bandwidth: The amount of data that can be transmitted over a network in a given amount of time. CDNs help reduce strain on origin servers and save bandwidth costs.
