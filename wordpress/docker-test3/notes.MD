In this docker-compose.yml file, we define four services:

db: This service runs the MySQL database and mounts a volume to store the database data persistently.
redis: This service runs the Redis cache server.
wordpress: This service runs the WordPress application and depends on the db and redis services. We expose port 8000 to access the WordPress application.
nginx: This service runs the Nginx web server and depends on the wordpress service. We expose port 80 to access the Nginx server.

We also define a volumes section to create the db_data volume for persistently storing the MySQL database data.

The WORDPRESS_CONFIG_EXTRA environment variable is used to configure Redis caching in WordPress. The WP_REDIS_HOST and WP_REDIS_PORT variables specify the Redis host and port, while WP_REDIS_PASSWORD specifies the Redis password if one is required. WP_CACHE_KEY_SALT should be set to a unique value to prevent cache collisions, and WP_CACHE enables Redis object caching in WordPress.
